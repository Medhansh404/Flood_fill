# Flood_fill
Tasks to do:
1). Get hold/Load the image to work upon it.
2). Now start the work on the image. We have to learn that
3). Once we get to the part of being able to edit the image we will try various search and graph algos learnt to check best complexity.
In the search part we aim to find the most used color and then replace it with the input color given by user input of if not we'll go with the least used color in the jpeg
4). Actually replace the colors via file manipulation and working of Jpeg.
5). ***BONUS*** If this task accompalished we move on to concurrently run this on multiple files at a time.


SO that's it let's begin the journey :)
